    "[Spark](http://spark.apache.org) is a framework for parallel distributed data processing on a set of commodity machines. It frees the user from duties like task scheduling, data transfer and fault tolerance, so that they can focus on programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark programming model uses the Map-Reduce model as a basis, simplifying its usage and extending it with more functionality. The following are two basic concepts in Spark:\n",
    "* `Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)`: an RDD is a distributed collection of items. The collection is divided in partitions, and these partitions are the units of parallelism.\n",
    "* `Transformations and actions`: the user can apply either transformations or actions on RDDs. Transformations are `lazy`, they are not applied right away, unlike actions. In other words, one can apply a chain of transformations to an RDD, but only when appending an action to that chain the whole computation graph will start executing. `map` is an example of a transformation, while `reduce` is an action. However, Spark is not limited to just map and reduce: it offers a rich variety of functional-style operators. Although we will not use all those operators in this exercise, you can find a complete list [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html).\n",
